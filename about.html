				<h2><u>About Us</u></h2>
				<h4 class="bgcolor">
				A Dog's Life was established in 2023 to serve the boarding needs 
				of our daycare clients. There was a search for property in the greater
				chicago area that would enable our daycare clients to not go too far out of their 
				way to see us. A Dog's Life center sits on nearly five acres in a quiet valley 
				next to a horse ranch. It is our mission to always do what is best for the dog 
				because your dog deserves the very best!
