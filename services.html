			<u>Luxury Dog Boarding in Chicago, IL</u>
			</h3>
			<h4 class="bgcolor">
			A Dog's Life Resort is happy to offer all dogs boarding with us their own personal, cozy room with
			full glass-front, kept cool by a climate-controlled facility and warmed with radiant-floor heating.
			Each room comes complete with a comfortable bed and soft, clean bedding, plus 24/7 access to clean water
			– our rooms are also plenty big enough to accommodate most bedding from home if your companion has a favorite blanket or bed.
			If you are interested in boarding multiple dogs, we can certainly place them in the same room if they get 
			along well, two large dogs or up to four small dogs may comfortably share one of our suites together.
			A Dog's Life also offers Double-Rooms, featuring two rooms with an adjoining door for families with
			multiple dogs who can be together sometimes, but would benefit from their own space at mealtime and overnight.

			<h4 class="bgcolor">
				At A Dog's Life Center socialized dogs can get the physical and mental stimulation that they need 
				to have a happy and healthy daycare experience! At ADLC we focus on the whole dog. Your pooch will 
				enjoy small playgroups matched with similar playstyles, comfortable rest periods, cuddles, positive 
				reinforcement guidance, and daily report cards including photos. <br>
				<br>
				The traditional free-for-all daycare style often results in overly tired or exhausted pups. 
				Exhaustion breeds behavior issues and can lead to many dogs not enjoying the experience. Mental 
				stimulation is just as important as physical activity. Our goal with ADLC is to engage every dog 
				physically AND mentally while also providing adequate and necessary rest periods.

			<h4 class="bgcolor">
			It is A Dog's Life's utmost desire to always do what is best for the dog in any of our services and our 
			grooming salon strives to make each pet’s experience a positive one. Doggy Haven’s experienced and 
			knowledgeable grooming staff offers an array of services including bathing, haircuts, nail trimming or 
			grinding, ear cleaning and/or plucking, anal gland expression, and teeth brushing. All of our grooming 
			services require an appointment. Pets must be fully vaccinated with all required immunizations. We ask 
			that you bring the vaccine info with you to your appointment, or send it to us ahead of time, as we are
			not able to contact your veterinarian for you. Puppies must be at least 8 weeks old, and can be up to 6 months 
			old without a Rabies vaccination.<br>
			<br>	
			Please let our groomers know about all health and/or behavior concerns your dog might have: lumps, bumps, scratches, 
			scrapes, previous surgeries/injuries, arthritis, breathing issues, heart conditions, disabilities, anxieties, 
			places your dog doesn’t like to be touched, things your dog might react negatively to. In addition, we 
			use a variety of shampoos to best suit your dog’s coat and skin needs. Please let us know if your dog has 
			allergies, sensitive skin or coat issues that you would like us to address.

			<h3 class="border">Pricing</h3>
			<h4 class="bgcolor">
			Grooming prices depend on size, age, comfort, coat condition, and the type of service being done for each 
			dog. We can give an estimated cost over the phone, but this is not a guaranteed price. A more accurate 
			quote can be given upon meeting the dog.
